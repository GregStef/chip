{"name":"Chip","body":"# chip\r\n\r\n`chip` is a local and remote log parsing and monitoring tool for system admins and developers. \r\nIt wraps the features of `swatch`, `tee`, `tail`, `grep`, `ccze`, and `mail`\r\ninto one, with some extras. Still an 'alpha'. Watch the [screencast](http://codefury.net/2011/04/video-chip-a-log-file-monitor-multiplexer/)!\r\n\r\n## One line install\r\n\r\nWant to jump right in? This will work on most *nix systems. You _may_ have to execute it with `sudo`.\r\n\r\n`perl -e \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/gist/940608/install-chip)\"`\r\n\r\nNow read all about what you've just installed :)\r\n\r\n## What chip can do for you, really quickly\r\n\r\n* Tail multiple logs at once, even remote logs\r\n* Search multiple logs (even remote ones) for patterns. Like grep across n hosts/files\r\n* Monitor multiple logs for occurrences of some match. Ie, log a certain line, send an email, start a process, more.\r\n\r\n## The basics\r\n\r\n`chip` starts up and tries to open log file(s), either local or remote. If one isn't specified, it reads from standard input.\r\nIt goes through each line looking for patterns that _you_ have specified as arguments. When it finds a match, chip does \r\nwhatever you told it to do with that match.\r\n\r\nMaybe you'd want to:\r\n\r\n1. Show the match(es) on the screen (like grep)\r\n2. Colorize matches (like a colorizer)\r\n3. Follow the file (like tail)\r\n4. Log it to a file (like output redirection)\r\n5. Have the line emailed to you (maybe for _really_ important stuff)\r\n6. Kick off another program\r\n7. Any combination of the above, with any number of matches, all at once\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n### Split matches into different files\r\n\r\nYou have a long-running process that prints out its progress. Some items\r\nmight be errors (maybe prefixed with 'ERROR'), others are warnings.\r\n\r\n`$ ./lame-process | chip --match0=ERROR --log0=errors.txt --match1=WARN --log1=warnings.txt`\r\n\r\n### View some matches in your terminal, stick others in a file\r\n\r\nYou're about to run a script that does something nasty, like importing 1,000s\r\nof email addresses into an email service that rhymes with 'mailpimp'. A whole\r\nbunch of status lines get output, along with occasional errors.\r\n\r\nYou want to run the script, see only the errors on the screen, and at the same time, \r\nsend all output to one file and all errors to another.\r\n\r\n`$ ./email-import | chip --match0='.*' --log0=output.txt --match1='ERROR' --log1=errors.txt --screen1`\r\n\r\n### Highlight matches in a terminal, and have errors emailed to you, and logged\r\n\r\nWant to get notified whenever a fatal (like an HTTP 500) error occurs and is logged to some file? \r\nWant to log them separately too? Want to view all output as it goes by (like `tail`), but highlight \r\nfatal errors in red? No prob. This time, in shorthand:\r\n\r\n`$ chip -f -m0='HTTP 500' -s0='red' -e0=katzgrau@gmail.com -L0=fatal.txt -m1='.*' -s1 error_log.txt` \r\n\r\n### The kicker: Do all of the above on multiple, remote files\r\n\r\nchip can tail multiple files too. It will also tail files over ssh! Ever want to monitor multiple logs and separate\r\nboxes behind a load balancer? Let's do the last example again but with two remote files:\r\n\r\n`$ chip -f -m0='HTTP 500' -s0='red' -e0=katzgrau@gmail.com -L0=fatal.txt -m1='.*' -s1 username@www1.example.com:/var/log/errors.log username@www2.example.com:/var/log/errors.log` \r\n\r\n## Power users\r\n\r\nHere are some tips for making chip super-useful:\r\n\r\n### When dealing with remote servers, set up ssh keys (authorized_keys)\r\n\r\nYour chip commands will run quickly without prompting you for your password every time you run a chip command\r\n\r\n### alias chip for an easy remote grep\r\n\r\nIn .bashrc, put something like:\r\n\r\n`alias grepprod='chip -s0 username@www1.example.com:/var/log/errors.log username@www2.example.com:/var/log/errors.log'` \r\n\r\nThen from the prompt, all you need to grep through *all* of your prod logs is:\r\n\r\n`grepprod -m0=[pattern]`\r\n\r\n### Command not working? Try -d\r\n\r\nType out an entire `chip` command, and tack on -d. Chip will tell you exactly what it was about to do.\r\n\r\n`./chip -f -i0='(error|fatal)' -s0=red -e0=katzgrau@gmail.com,moo@moo.com -c=katzgrau@gmail.com log.txt example.com:/tmp/log.txt -d`\r\n\r\n    chip is planning to open ...\r\n    -------------------------------------------------\r\n      File: log.txt\r\n      SSH : [none] @ example.com => /tmp/log.txt\r\n    with these patterns and associated handlers\r\n    -------------------------------------------------\r\n      Pattern #0 => /(error|fatal)/i\r\n      - screen => red\r\n      - email => katzgrau@gmail.com,moo@moo.com\r\n    with these options\r\n    -------------------------------------------------\r\n      follow => 1\r\n      debug => 1\r\n      complete => katzgrau@gmail.com\r\n\r\n## More Fun Stuff\r\n\r\nHow about kicking off some process every time something specific shows up in the log?\r\n\r\n`$ chip --follow --match0='out of space' --exec0='rm -rf tmp/*' maillog`\r\n\r\nHow about being notified of when a script ends too?\r\n\r\n`$ ./alter-table | chip --complete=katzgrau@gmail.com --match0=ERROR --log0=errors.txt`\r\n\r\nHow about color-coding your output?\r\n\r\n`$ chip --follow --match0=ERROR --screen0='bold red on_black' --match1=WARN --screen1=yellow --match2=INFO --screen2=blue ap_log.txt` \r\n\r\n## Feature List\r\n\r\n* Input by STDIN or file\r\n* Open local or remote files (piggybacks on `ssh`)\r\n* `tail`-ing of input files\r\n* Pattern-based matching of lines\r\n* Email notification on matches all-at-once or per-line\r\n* Color-coded screen output for matches\r\n* Logging of matches in separate files\r\n* Arbitrary command execution for matches\r\n* Adding as many command per match as needed\r\n* Email notification on script completion\r\n* Very portable, fast (perl)\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nTo view the usage:\r\n\r\n`$ chip --help`\r\n\r\n## Maintainer\r\n\r\nThis project was written and is maintained by Kenny Katzgrau at [codefury.net](http://codefury.net). Twitter: [@\\_kennyk\\_](http://twitter.com/_kennyk_).\r\n\r\n## Naming\r\n\r\n`chip` used to be named `stalk`. Before that, it was named `divvy`. I found out \r\nthere was a window manager named 'Divvy'. This fact ate at my sanity for weeks, and I finally gave in. \r\n\r\n`stalk` was harder to pronounce and much creepier, but I appreciated the double-meaning. \r\nSince `stalk` monitored multiple remote files, the new name reflected the expanded\r\nscope of the project.\r\n\r\n... One hour later, I realized I would now be receiving emails from `stalk`. This bothered\r\nme to the point that I knew another name change was iminent. `stalk` was just too creepy.\r\n\r\nThe utility is now named `chip`. Chip is everybody's innocent pal, right? He's no \r\n`stalk`er, that's for sure. `chip` has a similar play on words (log chipper).\r\nCouldn't you trust `chip` to keep an eye on things while you're away?\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nWritten in Perl.

<p><code>chip</code> is a local and remote log parsing and monitoring tool for system admins and developers. 
It wraps the features of <code>swatch</code>, <code>tee</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>grep</code>, <code>ccze</code>, and <code>mail</code>
into one, with some extras. Still an 'alpha'. Watch the <a href="http://codefury.net/2011/04/video-chip-a-log-file-monitor-multiplexer/">screencast</a>!</p>

<h2>One line install</h2>

<p>Want to jump right in? This will work on most *nix systems. You <em>may</em> have to execute it with <code>sudo</code>.</p>

<p><code>perl -e "$(curl -fsSL <a href="https://raw.github.com/gist/940608/install-chip)">https://raw.github.com/gist/940608/install-chip)</a>"</code></p>

<p>Now read all about what you've just installed :)</p>

<h2>What chip can do for you, really quickly</h2>

<ul>
<li>Tail multiple logs at once, even remote logs</li>
<li>Search multiple logs (even remote ones) for patterns. Like grep across n hosts/files</li>
<li>Monitor multiple logs for occurrences of some match. Ie, log a certain line, send an email, start a process, more.</li>
</ul><h2>The basics</h2>

<p><code>chip</code> starts up and tries to open log file(s), either local or remote. If one isn't specified, it reads from standard input.
It goes through each line looking for patterns that <em>you</em> have specified as arguments. When it finds a match, chip does 
whatever you told it to do with that match.</p>

<p>Maybe you'd want to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Show the match(es) on the screen (like grep)</li>
<li>Colorize matches (like a colorizer)</li>
<li>Follow the file (like tail)</li>
<li>Log it to a file (like output redirection)</li>
<li>Have the line emailed to you (maybe for <em>really</em> important stuff)</li>
<li>Kick off another program</li>
<li>Any combination of the above, with any number of matches, all at once</li>
</ol><h2>Examples</h2>

<h3>Split matches into different files</h3>

<p>You have a long-running process that prints out its progress. Some items
might be errors (maybe prefixed with 'ERROR'), others are warnings.</p>

<p><code>$ ./lame-process | chip --match0=ERROR --log0=errors.txt --match1=WARN --log1=warnings.txt</code></p>

<h3>View some matches in your terminal, stick others in a file</h3>

<p>You're about to run a script that does something nasty, like importing 1,000s
of email addresses into an email service that rhymes with 'mailpimp'. A whole
bunch of status lines get output, along with occasional errors.</p>

<p>You want to run the script, see only the errors on the screen, and at the same time, 
send all output to one file and all errors to another.</p>

<p><code>$ ./email-import | chip --match0='.*' --log0=output.txt --match1='ERROR' --log1=errors.txt --screen1</code></p>

<h3>Highlight matches in a terminal, and have errors emailed to you, and logged</h3>

<p>Want to get notified whenever a fatal (like an HTTP 500) error occurs and is logged to some file? 
Want to log them separately too? Want to view all output as it goes by (like <code>tail</code>), but highlight 
fatal errors in red? No prob. This time, in shorthand:</p>

<p><code>$ chip -f -m0='HTTP 500' -s0='red' -e0=katzgrau@gmail.com -L0=fatal.txt -m1='.*' -s1 error_log.txt</code> </p>

<h3>The kicker: Do all of the above on multiple, remote files</h3>

<p>chip can tail multiple files too. It will also tail files over ssh! Ever want to monitor multiple logs and separate
boxes behind a load balancer? Let's do the last example again but with two remote files:</p>

<p><code>$ chip -f -m0='HTTP 500' -s0='red' -e0=katzgrau@gmail.com -L0=fatal.txt -m1='.*' -s1 username@www1.example.com:/var/log/errors.log username@www2.example.com:/var/log/errors.log</code> </p>

<h2>Power users</h2>

<p>Here are some tips for making chip super-useful:</p>

<h3>When dealing with remote servers, set up ssh keys (authorized_keys)</h3>

<p>Your chip commands will run quickly without prompting you for your password every time you run a chip command</p>

<h3>alias chip for an easy remote grep</h3>

<p>In .bashrc, put something like:</p>

<p><code>alias grepprod='chip -s0 username@www1.example.com:/var/log/errors.log username@www2.example.com:/var/log/errors.log'</code> </p>

<p>Then from the prompt, all you need to grep through <em>all</em> of your prod logs is:</p>

<p><code>grepprod -m0=[pattern]</code></p>

<h3>Command not working? Try -d</h3>

<p>Type out an entire <code>chip</code> command, and tack on -d. Chip will tell you exactly what it was about to do.</p>

<p><code>./chip -f -i0='(error|fatal)' -s0=red -e0=katzgrau@gmail.com,moo@moo.com -c=katzgrau@gmail.com log.txt example.com:/tmp/log.txt -d</code></p>

<pre><code>chip is planning to open ...
-------------------------------------------------
  File: log.txt
  SSH : [none] @ example.com =&gt; /tmp/log.txt
with these patterns and associated handlers
-------------------------------------------------
  Pattern #0 =&gt; /(error|fatal)/i
  - screen =&gt; red
  - email =&gt; katzgrau@gmail.com,moo@moo.com
with these options
-------------------------------------------------
  follow =&gt; 1
  debug =&gt; 1
  complete =&gt; katzgrau@gmail.com
</code></pre>

<h2>More Fun Stuff</h2>

<p>How about kicking off some process every time something specific shows up in the log?</p>

<p><code>$ chip --follow --match0='out of space' --exec0='rm -rf tmp/*' maillog</code></p>

<p>How about being notified of when a script ends too?</p>

<p><code>$ ./alter-table | chip --complete=katzgrau@gmail.com --match0=ERROR --log0=errors.txt</code></p>

<p>How about color-coding your output?</p>

<p><code>$ chip --follow --match0=ERROR --screen0='bold red on_black' --match1=WARN --screen1=yellow --match2=INFO --screen2=blue ap_log.txt</code> </p>

<h2>Naming</h2>

<p><code>chip</code> used to be named <code>stalk</code>. Before that, it was named <code>divvy</code>. I found out 
there was a window manager named 'Divvy'. This fact ate at my sanity for weeks, and I finally gave in. </p>

<p><code>stalk</code> was harder to pronounce and much creepier, but I appreciated the double-meaning. 
Since <code>stalk</code> monitored multiple remote files, the new name reflected the expanded
scope of the project.</p>

<p>... One hour later, I realized I would now be receiving emails from <code>stalk</code>. This bothered
me to the point that I knew another name change was iminent. <code>stalk</code> was just too creepy.</p>

<p>The utility is now named <code>chip</code>. Chip is everybody's innocent pal, right? He's no 
<code>stalk</code>er, that's for sure. <code>chip</code> has a similar play on words (log chipper).
Couldn't you trust <code>chip</code> to keep an eye on things while you're away?</p>
